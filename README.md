# Python Self Destructing Code
this code is basically an overwriter for your python code, when executed it overwrites the whole code with whatever you wish, it can be nothing or some text to hide it

i will add a functionality to change the file type and name later!

## WARNING 
### THIS WILL EREASE ALL YOUR CODE WITH NO BACKUP, MAKE SURE TO MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE ADDING AND TESTING
### I WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY EREASE IT
### AT LEAST HAVE AN IDE OPEN IF YOU WONT MAKE A BACKUP TO BE ABLE TO RESTORE IT FROM THERE WITH `Ctrl + Z`
